You are a senior full-stack developer. Update the existing Property Masters marketing website to add a dedicated “Founders” page and link it in the global navigation and footer. Detect the stack (Next.js / React + Vite / plain HTML) and implement accordingly. Follow this spec exactly.

=== 1) Page purpose & route ===
- Create a page at /founders with a clean, responsive layout.
- Hero section: founder’s name, title, 1-sentence positioning, CTA buttons (“Contact” → /contact, “Our Story” → anchor to bio section).
- Include an above-the-fold founder photo (the image I will upload), with proper alt text and lazy-loading below the fold.

=== 2) Content (use this structured data) ===
FOUNDER_DATA = {
  "companyName": "Property Masters",
  "founder": {
    "fullName": "FIRST LAST",
    "title": "Founder & Managing Partner",
    "location": "City, Province/State",
    "shortPitch": "One sentence on what makes the founder/firm different.",
    "bioParagraphs": [
      "Paragraph 1 — origin story, experience, mission.",
      "Paragraph 2 — track record, notable results, approach.",
      "Paragraph 3 — values, client commitment, personal note."
    ],
    "highlights": [
      "X+ doors managed / Y years experience / Z successful projects",
      "Design–Build expertise across residential and light commercial",
      "Licensed/insured; vendor network across Province/State"
    ],
    "contact": {
      "email": "hello@propertymasters.ca",
      "phone": "(XXX) XXX-XXXX",
      "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/USERNAME"
    },
    "headshot": {
      "fileName": "founder-headshot.webp",
      "alt": "Portrait of FIRST LAST, Founder of Property Masters"
    }
  }
}

=== 3) Visual & UX requirements ===
- Layout: two-column hero (text + photo) that collapses to stacked on mobile.
- Use existing brand fonts/colors; if none, use neutral grayscale with a subtle accent matching site primary color.
- Sections:
  1. Hero (name, title, shortPitch, headshot).
  2. Highlights (3–6 compact stat/feature cards).
  3. Bio / Our Story (multi-paragraph).
  4. Contact (email/phone buttons + LinkedIn icon).
  5. Callout banner (“Work with Property Masters”) with button to /contact.
- Add breadcrumbs (“Home > Founders”) and a small trust bar if the site already has logos/testimonials.

=== 4) Assets & performance ===
- Accept an uploaded image from me; convert to .webp (max width 1600px), generate 3 sizes (400/800/1600), and implement <img srcset> for responsive loading.
- Add loading="eager" for the hero image and fetchpriority="high".
- Ensure Lighthouse-friendly: semantic headings (H1/H2), contrast ≥ 4.5:1, focus states, keyboard nav.

=== 5) SEO & structured data ===
- Metadata: title “Founders | Property Masters”, description from shortPitch.
- Open Graph/Twitter tags using the hero image.
- Add JSON-LD Person schema based on FOUNDER_DATA.founder and Organization for the company. Nest the founder under worksFor.
- Include canonical tag for /founders.

=== 6) Navigation & footer ===
- Add a “Founders” link to the main nav (between “About” and “Services” if present) and to the footer “Company” column.
- Ensure active state for /founders route.

=== 7) Implementation details per stack ===
- Next.js (App Router):
  - Create app/founders/page.tsx with a server component pulling from a local data/founder.ts export of FOUNDER_DATA.
  - Place images in public/images/founder/ and use next/image with sizes and priority.
  - Add metadata via `export const metadata`.
- Next.js (Pages Router):
  - Create pages/founders.tsx, import data from lib/founder.ts, use next/head for meta.
- React + Vite:
  - Create src/pages/Founders.tsx and add a route in the router config.
  - Put images in public/images/founder/, use standard <img> with srcSet.
- Static HTML:
  - Add founders.html, link styles from existing CSS, and wire nav/footer links.

=== 8) Styling ===
- Use existing design system/components where available. Otherwise:
  - Container max-width 1200px, generous whitespace, balanced line length (~65ch).
  - Cards with subtle shadow and 12–16px radius.
  - Buttons: primary (solid) to /contact, secondary (outline) to #our-story.

=== 9) Accessibility & QA ===
- Provide descriptive alt text, labelled icons, skip-to-content link.
- Use proper landmarks: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>.
- Run a11y checks; fix any errors/warnings.

=== 10) Deliverables ===
- All new/modified files with clear comments // Founders page.
- A README snippet explaining where to update FOUNDER_DATA and how to replace the headshot.
- Confirm the page builds and is reachable from nav and direct URL /founders.

After implementing, prompt me to upload the founder headshot image so you can place it at public/images/founder/founder-headshot.webp (or the equivalent path for the stack) and regenerate the responsive variants. Then show me a preview URL or dev server link.
